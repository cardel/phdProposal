\chapter{Expected Results}

Mutation testing offers a valuable approach to assessing potential software vulnerabilities. In the case of RESTful APIs, it allows assessing how access to sensitive data can be managed. However, challenges arise due to issues identified in the implementation of OWASP recommendations during the development cycle, as well as the time-consuming nature of mutation testing. Therefore, it is essential to specify mutation operators that can address these problems while remaining feasible within the development cycle.

The goal of this work is to specify generic mutation operators that can be applied in various software testing tools to analyze the quality of security in this type of data exchange applications.

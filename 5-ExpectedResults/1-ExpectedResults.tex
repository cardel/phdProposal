\chapter{Expected Results}

Mutation testing offers an interesting option to evaluate potential vulnerabilities in software, in the case of RESTFul APIs there is the possibility to evaluate how access to sensitive data can be managed. However, there are certain challenges related to the fact that in the development cycle problems have been identified in the implementation of OSWAP recommendations and that mutation testing can be time consuming, so it is necessary to specify mutation operators that can address these problems and at the same time be feasible within the development cycle.

This work aims to specify generic mutation operators that can be applied in different software testing tools to analyze the quality of security in this type of data exchange applications.

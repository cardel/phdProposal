In this chapter we will discuss the methodology of the project. We will discuss the process of identification of the scope vulnerabilities, the description of mutation operators and the creation of the tool for mutation testing.  In the section \ref{sec:researching_methodology} we discuss the collecting and analyzing of a set of vulnerabilities and describe the process of description of mutation operators. The section \ref{sec:phases} specifies the structuration of the project in for phases: systematic review, design of operators, development of the tool and the evaluation of the mutation operators. Afterward, in the section \ref{sec:activities} we describe the activities according to the researching methodology and the phases of the project.

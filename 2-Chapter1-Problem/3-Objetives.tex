         \textbf{Specific objective} & \textbf{Expected result} \\ \hline
         1.  Identification of the elements of the security policies in RESTful APIs  &  Characteristics of the security policies in RESTful API, related to exchanging of data   \\  \hline
         2. Describe a set of code-based security-aware mutation operators for testing of security policies   files in RESTful APIs  & Description of the mutation operators, introducing some misconfiguration security policies in the exchanging of data in RESTful APIs\\  \hline
         3. Develop the set of security-aware mutation operators for security configuration files  & Description of the operators to be applied in security configuration files \\  \hline
         4. Evaluate the proposed security-aware mutation operators in the coverage of the security tests  & Report about the performance of the created operators against tools from the literature.

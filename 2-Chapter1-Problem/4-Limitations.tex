\section{Limitations}

This research proposal considers the next limitations:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item This thesis will only cover the security policies of the frameworks in 2024
    \item The focus of the thesis will be frameworks Django Rest and Flask in Python language, because they are highly used on different applications
    \item The mutation operators are code-based under the idea to create mutants from the source code
    \item The mutation operators are designed base on security unit testing
    \item The mutation operators are designed to test the security policies of applications built with Django Rest and Flask frameworks
    \item The scope is to test the security policies of open source applications without integration with other frameworks
\end{enumerate}

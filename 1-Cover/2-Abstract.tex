%Background

Mutation testing changes the code to see if the tests can find the alterations. Then, we can know if the tests can detect security issues and unexpected flaws.

%objectives

RESTFul APIs is a mechanism for exchanging information between applications, some of this sensitive information. Research suggests that current security tools are not enough for privacy problems and vulnerabilities.

%methods

Mutation testing is a way to test for RESTFul API vulnerabilities by evaluating different data vulnerability and access scenarios. Our proposal aims to identify and create specific vulnerabilities in Flask and Django Rest frameworks using Python language, based on the set of vulnerabilities specified by OSWAP for 2023. We will then evaluate the effectiveness of the tests typically performed during the development of these applications.

%hypotehsis

Security-aware mutation operators can boost RESTful API software testing coverage to ensure secure access to sensitive data.

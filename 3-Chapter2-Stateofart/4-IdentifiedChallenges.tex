\section{Identified Challenges}

According to the literature review we identified some current challenges in the interception between mutation testing and security in the development of RESTful APIs.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item RESTful APIs handle sensitive information that needs to be protected. While software testing evaluates the information is managed, the constant discovery of new vulnerabilities indicates an opportunity for improvement in this area.
    \item Mutation testing has proven to be a strategy for evaluating the security of applications. Although significant work has been done related to specific applications in languages such as Java and Python, there is an opportunity to extend these efforts to the development of RESTful APIs.  
    \item Security remains a significant challenge in software development. Several recent studies have identified security gaps in many applications, which could be studied to provide a framework for the development of tools for assessing data security and generating recommendations for improvement.
\end{enumerate}

Therefore, mutation testing is identified as a potential strategy to contribute to information security in Restful APIs by providing a framework for assessing test coverage in terms of vulnerabilities.

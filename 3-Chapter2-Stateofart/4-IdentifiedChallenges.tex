\section{Identified Challenges}

According to the literature review we identified some current challenges in the interception between mutation testing and security in the development of RESTFul APIs.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item RESTFul APIs handle sensitive information that needs to be protected, software testing evaluates how they are handled, but because vulnerabilities are constantly being discovered, there is an opportunity for improvement in this area.
    \item Mutation testing has proven to be a strategy for evaluating the security of applications, there has been a lot of work done related to specific applications in languages such as Java and Python, there is an opportunity to contribute to the development of RESTFul API.
    \item Security is a challenge for software development today, and several recent studies have identified security gaps in many of them, which could be studied to provide a framework for the development of tools to assess data security and generate recommendations for improvement.
\end{enumerate}

Therefore, it is identified that mutation testing can be a strategy to contribute to information security in RESTFul APIs by providing a framework for assessing test coverage in terms of vulnerabilities.
